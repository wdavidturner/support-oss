# Support-OSS

**Figure out where your open source donations will have the most impact.**

[support-oss.dev](https://support-oss.dev)

## The Problem

You want to support open source. You know your project depends on hundreds of packages maintained by real people. But there's no easy way to say: _"Here's what I use — tell me where my donation would matter most."_

That's what we're building.

## The Vision

Support-OSS aims to bring transparency to open source sustainability by combining:

- **Sustainability insights** — Understanding which projects need support and why
- **Funding aggregation** — A clean view across OpenCollective, GitHub Sponsors, and other platforms
- **Maintainer identity** — Credit the humans, not just the packages
- **Smart allocation** — Help donors prioritize based on both impact and need

### For Developers

Paste your `dependencies` or `devDependencies` and understand your dependency landscape:

- Which packages need support most
- Suggested allocation of your donation budget
- Direct links to donate, wherever the maintainer accepts support
- Packages grouped by maintainer

### For Maintainers

Claim your packages and tell your story:

- Verify ownership and update funding links
- Set your project's sustainability status
- See aggregate usage data from the community
- Connect with your supporters

## Status

This project is in early development. We're building toward a platform that makes open source funding more transparent and effective for everyone involved.
